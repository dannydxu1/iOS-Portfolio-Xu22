# iOS-Portfolio-Xu22

## Introduction
Hello! I'm Danny Xu, and this is my high school computer science portfolio. 
- My first computer science class was AP Computer Science Principles, where I obtained a holistic introduction to computer science; I learned about types of data, algorithms and programming, and computer systems/networks. 
- Next I took AP Computer Science A (Java), where I learned about object-oriented programming, arrays, inheritance, classes, and recursion. Taking AP CS A solidified my interest in computer science and gave me a foundation to learn more languages. 
- Currently, I am taking iOS App Development and learning how to use Swift and XCode to create iOS applications.

## [AP Computer Science Principles: CREATE Final](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ClsD0Z-4PiMSP5-qt0z-w4KmchkOKExmfA0RjT2hSvk/edit?usp=sharing)
At the time I took APCSP, I was obsessed with maximizing my productivity, so of course, I made a productivity app for my final project. The app was built using MIT App Inventor and was a To-Do List/Pomodoro Study Timer App. This was my first taste of mobile app development, and this project taught me about the app development process.

## [AP Computer Science A: Advent of Code](https://github.com/dannydxu1/AOC2021)
During APCSA, I gained a proficient understanding of Java and object-oriented programming. During December of 2021, I followed along with Advent of Code's daily programming challenges which I completed in Java. Solving these questions familiarized me with the concept of scanners and arrays, and how to debug complex code.

## [Reselling Bot](https://github.com/dannydxu1/SneakerBot)
Since my freshman year of high school, I have resold clothing and shoes. During my senior year, with my newfound programming skills, I decided to try my hand at web-scraping and web automation, in order to create my own bot to automate purchasing products. I did this through JavaScript and VSCode, and through various NodeJS libraries. I started with the Puppeteer library within NodeJS, which I used to create a script that automatically adds items to shopping carts and autofill payment information.

While using Puppeteer, I learned more about HTML and CSS, as being able to read what different tags meant was crucial for traversing the DOM of websites. However, Puppeteer was not enough for my needs, so I started learning how to use NodeJS's cheerio and request libraries. As both a custom mechanical keyboard enthusiast and a penny-pincher, I worked with my friend to create a Discord Bot, using Discord's JS API, that takes in keywords and returns recent posts scraped from a subreddit for selling mechanical keyboards.

## [Stock Scraper](https://github.com/dannydxu1/Reddit-Webscraping/blob/main/StockScraper.js)
While learning how to buy/sell stocks within my Personal Finance class, I found an oppurtunity to automate the process our teacher recommended to evaluate stocks. My script takes in ticker symbols, and evaluates the stock, based off of four criterion, using company information scraped from Yahoo Finance.

## [Tip Calculator App](https://github.com/RohitP123/FinalTipCalc)
This was my first Swift app that I worked on with a partner. It was created by following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnHDbTDPu3s&t=911s), but it was enough to familiarize me with the basics of Swift. This tutorial taught me about buttons, text fields, and other types of objects in SwiftUI. I also learned about state variables and how to use views to simplify apps.

## [Cash Register Counter](https://github.com/RohitP123/Cash-Register-App/blob/main/README.md)
This was my first "real" Swift app that I made for iOS without following any tutorials. It is a SwiftUI app and was created to make it easier for workers to count money within cash registers. Creating this app taught me a great deal about working with a partner and source control, as well as how to implement and receieve feedback on apps and to account for different types of users and devices. I also learned how to use paddings, bindings, and how to make a UI that "makes sense".
