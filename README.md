## Introduction
Hello! I'm Danny Xu, and this is my computer science portfolio. In elementary school, I started with drag-and-drop programming languages like MIT's scratch. My first taste of "real" programming happened in the sixth grade when I took a Java class. In high school, I took AP Computer Science Principles, where I obtained a holistic introduction to computer science. During my Sophomore year, I joined my school's Futurist Academy club, where I worked on passion projects with friends. In my senior year, I took AP Computer Science A (Java), which solidified my interest in computer science and gave me a foundation to learn more languages. 

## AP Computer Science Principles
During APCSP, I learned about the components of algorithms, how computers/the Internet work, and worked on a final project called the CREATE project. At the time I was obsessed with maximizing my productivity, so of course I made a productivity app for my final project. The app was built in MIT App Inventor, and was a To Do List and a Pomodoro Study Timer App. The user input was stored on TinyWebDB, and there were even multiple color themes. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95701961/161796430-61962fdc-8c79-43c0-a29f-1c22c7d38418.png)

## AP Computer Science A
During APCSA, I gained a proficient understanding of Java and object-oriented programming. During the Holiday season of 2021, I followed along with Advent of Code's programming challenges. My solutions are linked [here](https://github.com/dannydxu1/AOC2021). 

## Futurist Academy
Within the Futurist Academy club at my high school, I worked on a myriad of extracurricular programming projects with my classmates. During 2020, I gained a rudimentary understanding of Python, and worked my clubmates to create graphical visualizations of data sets. During 2021, we started using Flutter to build apps for clubs at our school. 

## Web Scraping
Since my freshman year of high school, I have resold clothing and shoes. During my senior year, with my newfound programming skills, I decided to try my hand at web-scraping and web-automation, in order to create my own bot to automate purchasing products. I did this through JavaScript and VSCode, and through various NodeJS libraries. I started with the Puppeteer library within NodeJS, which I used to create a script that automatically adds items to shopping carts and autofills payment information. My "bot" is linked [here](https://github.com/dannydxu1/SneakerBot). I even made a guide for my clubmates to set up Puppeteer. ![Screen Shot 2022-04-05 at 11 21 26 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95701961/161800430-de55e37b-00b2-4765-a239-9b0ae862e934.png)



## Github
After working with my classmates, I learned how to how to push/pull/commit repositories Github Desktop as well as in command line through terminal. 

##XCode
After watching hours of tutorials, I learned the fundamentals of how Swift and XCode work, and the difference between SwiftUI and Swift Storyboard. I learned how to make a simple app and how constraints and the different horizontal/vertical stacks work. I also learned more about the front-end side of app development, discovering how to create a loading-screen, app-icon and how to affect other components of an app's UI.
