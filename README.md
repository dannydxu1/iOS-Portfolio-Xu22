## Introduction
Hello! I'm Danny Xu, and this is my computer science portfolio. In elementary school, I started with drag-and-drop programming languages like MIT's scratch. My first taste of "real" programming happened in the sixth grade when I took a Java class. In high school, I took AP Computer Science Principles, where I obtained a holistic introduction to computer science. During my Sophomore year, I joined my school's Futurist Academy club, where I worked on passion projects with friends. In my senior year, I took AP Computer Science A (Java), which solidified my interest in computer science and gave me a foundation to learn more languages. 

## AP Computer Science Principles
During APCSP, I learned about the components of algorithms, how computers/the Internet work, and worked on a final project called the CREATE project. At the time I was obsessed with maximizing my productivity, so of course I made a productivity app for my final project. The app was built in MIT App Inventor, and was a To Do List and a Pomodoro Study Timer App. The user input was stored on TinyWebDB, and there were even multiple color themes. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95701961/161796430-61962fdc-8c79-43c0-a29f-1c22c7d38418.png)

## AP Computer Science A
During APCSA, I gained a proficient understanding of Java and object-oriented programming. During the Holiday season of 2022, I followed along with Advent of Code's programming challenges. My solutions are linked [here](https://github.com/dannydxu1/AOC2021). 

## New to Github
After working with my classmates, I learned how to how to push/pull/commit repositories Github Desktop as well as in command line through terminal. 

## New to XCode
After watching hours of tutorials, I learned the fundamentals of how Swift and XCode work, and the difference between SwiftUI and Swift Storyboard. I learned how to make a simple app and how constraints and the different horizontal/vertical stacks work. I also learned more about the front-end side of app development, discovering how to create a loading-screen, app-icon and how to affect other components of an app's UI.
