## Introduction
Hello! I'm Danny Xu, and this is my computer science portfolio. In elementary school, I started with drag-and-drop programming languages like MIT's scratch. My first taste of "real" programming happened in the sixth grade when I took a Java class. In high school, I took AP Computer Science Principles, where I obtained a holistic introduction to computer science. During my Sophomore year, I joined my school's Futurist Academy club, where I worked on passion projects with friends. In my senior year, I took AP Computer Science A (Java), which solidified my interest in computer science and gave me a foundation to learn more languages. 

## AP Computer Science Principles
During APCSP, I learned about the components of algorithms, and how computers/the Internet work, and worked on a final project called the CREATE project. At the time I was obsessed with maximizing my productivity, so of course, I made a productivity app for my final project. The app was built using MIT App Inventor and was a To-Do List and a Pomodoro Study Timer App. The user input was stored on TinyWebDB, and there were even multiple color themes. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95701961/161796430-61962fdc-8c79-43c0-a29f-1c22c7d38418.png)

## AP Computer Science A
During APCSA, I gained a proficient understanding of Java and object-oriented programming. During the Holiday season of 2021, I followed along with Advent of Code's programming challenges. My solutions are linked [here](https://github.com/dannydxu1/AOC2021). 

## Futurist Academy
Within the Futurist Academy club at my high school, I worked on a myriad of extracurricular programming projects with my classmates. In 2020, I gained a rudimentary understanding of Python and worked with my clubmates to create graphical visualizations of data sets. In 2021, we started using Flutter to build apps for clubs at our school. 

## Web Scraping
Since my freshman year of high school, I have resold clothing and shoes. During my senior year, with my newfound programming skills, I decided to try my hand at web-scraping and web automation, in order to create my own bot to automate purchasing products. I did this through JavaScript and VSCode, and through various NodeJS libraries. I started with the Puppeteer library within NodeJS, which I used to create a script that automatically adds items to shopping carts and autofill payment information. My "bot" is linked [here](https://github.com/dannydxu1/SneakerBot). I even made a guide for my clubmates to set up Puppeteer.

While using Puppeteer, I learned more about HTML and CSS, as being able to read what different tags meant was crucial for traversing the DOM of websites. However, Puppeteer was not enough for my needs, so I started learning how to use NodeJS's cheerio (lightweight version of JQuery) and request libraries. As a custom mechanical keyboard enthusiast and penny-pincher, I worked with my friend to create a Discord Bot, using Discord's JS API, that takes in keywords and returns recent posts scraped from a subreddit for selling mechanical keyboards. The discord bot is linked [here](https://github.com/dannydxu1/Reddit-Webscraping/blob/main/scraper.js). 

To track my packages, I made a quick project to practice my JavaScript skills, called [USPS Scraper] (https://github.com/dannydxu1/Reddit-Webscraping/blob/main/usps.js) that takes in USPS links and scrapes the statuses of the packages. The project is linked

While learning how to buy/sell stocks within my Personal Finance class, I found an oppurtunity to automate the process our teacher recommended to evaluate stocks. My [StockScraper](https://github.com/dannydxu1/Reddit-Webscraping/blob/main/StockScraper.js) takes in ticker symbols, and evaluates the stock, based off of four criterion, using company information scraped from Yahoo FInance.

## Github
After working with my classmates, I learned how to how to push/pull/commit repositories on Github Desktop as well as in the command line through the terminal. 

## XCode
After watching hours of tutorials, I learned the fundamentals of how Swift and XCode work, and the difference between SwiftUI and Swift Storyboard. I learned how to make a simple app and how constraints and the different horizontal/vertical stacks work. I also learned more about the front-end side of app development, discovering how to create a loading screen, app-icon and how to affect other components of an app's UI.
